Frost Resource Package file format (.frp files)
===============================================

Frost Resource Package files can contain any type of resource.
Each resource has, at minimum, a name.
There are no restrictions on what a resource can be named.
However, it is recommended to use a delimiter, like a forward slash /, to logically group resources.
Resources may have additional optional parameters.
All parameters for resources are defined in the header of the resource file.
